/**
 * Run watch and catchup
 *
 *  --- Catchup ?
 *   If the bootstrap is long or the process has been stopped long enough,
 *   we are lagging behind few changes.
 *   catchup() will paginate through changes that we have missed.
 *
 *  --- Watch ?
 *   Watch is "Long Polled. This mode is not paginated and the event system in CouchDB send
 *     events as they arrive, which is super cool and reactive.
 *   One gotcha those events arrive at the same rate wether you are watching the last seq or not.
 *
 *   Example:
 *    listener A - up to date
 *    listener B - few sequences behind
 *
 *    package C is updated
 *
 *    listener A receive update C
 *    listener B receive update N
 *
 *    listener A is up to date again
 *    listener B is still few sequences behind and will not receive any other event
 *      until an other package is updated.
 *      It will never be up to date because he receive event at the same pace
 *      as they arrive in listener A, even if it's not the same package
 *
 *
 *  --- We could use catchup with a timeout between poll then?
 *   yes !
 *   When we are catched up, we could await between poll and we will receive N changes.
 *   But long-polling is more efficient in term of bandwidth and more reactive.
